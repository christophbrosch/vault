> [!Abstract]
>
> The classification of products generates a high effort for retail companies because products must be classified manually in many cases. To optimize the product data creation process, methods for automating product classification are necessary. An important component of product data records are digital product images. Due to the latest developments in pattern recognition, these images can be used for product classification. Artificial neural networks are already capable of classifying digital images with lower error rates than humans. But the enormous variety of products and frequent changes in the product assortment are big challenges for current methods for classifying product images automatically.
