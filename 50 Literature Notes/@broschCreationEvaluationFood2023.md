> : The enormous progress in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) enables retail companies to automate their processes and thus to save costs. Thereby, many AI-based automation approaches are based on machine learning and computer vision. The realization of such approaches requires high-quality training data. In this paper, we describe the creation process of an annotated dataset that contains 1,034 images of single food products, taken under studio conditions, annotated with 5 class labels and 30 object detection labels, which can be used for product recognition and classification tasks. We based all images and labels on standards presented by GS1, a global non-profit organisation. The objective of our work is to support the development of machine learning models in the retail domain and to provide a reference process for creating the necessary training data.

> The retail sector faces numerous challenges and opportunities due to rapid digitization and technological advancements. The growth of e-commerce has significantly impacted traditional retail, while advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer retailers the opportunity to automate various processes. Assortment planning, pricing, and promotion planning as well as instore logistics operations are just a few areas where AI can be applied.
