# Globus

Globus has sent us their whole online product catalog multiple times, during IMPRO they had included images which were used during [[@bast_2023]]'s research to classify according to gpc brick. For KE3P they sent us primarily descriptive data.

## Distribution

## Problem

While manually validating a small percentage (~5%) of the data, which was a very painful process, we found, that roughly ~31.6% of the products were assigned the wrong class. Some of which were systemic mistakes, some of which are listed here: [[14 Labeling]].
